			<h1>HapYak User Research</h1>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>HapYak provides a platform for organizations to add interactivity, such as quizzes, links, and chapters, to videos. As viewers interact with these elements, data is recorded and reported back to the organization allowing them to better understand their audience.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>As part of a partner project with Startup Institute, HapYak asked us to develop and implement a plan to gather feedback from users of their video editing/augmentation portal (these users will hereafter be referred to as editors).</p>
			<p>HapYak wanted to be sure that new editors weren't overwhelmed by the extensive toolset when first logging in. Specifically, they wanted to make sure they could easily:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Develop a goal for creating an interactive video (if they didn't already have one).</li>
				<li>Build an interactive video to achieve that goal.</li>
				<li>Share the video with viewers.</li>
				<li>View reports showing metrics based on the goal.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Additionally, they wanted to better understand their existing editors. In particular, they wanted to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Confirm the user personas.</li>
				<li>Understand how they used (or wanted to use) the portal.</li>
				<li>Understand any challenges they had using the portal.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The research results would be used to help HapYak develop and prioritize the list of product improvements and create a better experience for their customers.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>The Approach</h2>
			<p>We started by spending some time in the portal, using the toolset to add interactive components to a video. As we were new to the portal ourselves, we took notes about our experience and resulting product questions.</p>
			<p>We then spoke with the HapYak team to learn more about their customer base. They believed that editors fall into four main personas, each with their own goals and commonly used features:</p>

			<p>Once we had an understanding of the portal and the customer base, we began designing a process that would allow us to gather feedback from both new and existing editors across each of the four personas.</p>
			<h3>Existing Editor Feedback</h3>
			<p>For existing editors, we decided to conduct a survey. We divided these editors into two groups, long-term users and recently signed-up users, and asked them questions around each of HapYak's respective goals. We added logic to both surveys so people only saw questions applicable to them.</p>
			<p class="title">Long-Term Customer Survey</p>
			<p>This survey was sent to all video editors who had signed up to use HapYak more than 30 days ago and had been in the portal more than once. If they were active in the last 30 days, the survey message was set to appear in the portal the next time they logged in. If it had been longer than 30 days they received an email.</p>

			<p>The survey itself focused on why and how the editor uses the portal.</p>

			<p class="title">Recent Sign-Up Survey</p>
			<p>This survey was sent to all video editors who had signed up to use HapYak in the last 30 days. If they were active in the portal within the last 15 days, the survey message was set to appear in the portal the next time they logged in. If it had been longer than 15 days they received an email.</p>
			<p>The survey itself focused the editor on their experience the first time they logged into the portal (when they were a new user).</p>

			<h3>New Editor Feedback</h3>
			<p>To learn more about the experience of new editors, we decided to conduct in-person testing on people who had never used the platform before. We held four test sessions, one for each user persona, and ran participants through the following procedure:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Provided an intro to HapYak and the test we were conducting.</li>
				<li>Showed them the six-minute instructional video that appears in the portal the first time a user logs in.</li>
				<li>Asked them to take fifteen minutes to play around with the tools and try to complete the goal associated with their user persona.</li>
				<li>Led a group discussion with follow up questions on the task.</li>
				<li>Provided a debrief on the purpose of the testing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>During the portion where participants were playing around with the tools we had one researcher paired up with each participant. Participants were asked to talk through their actions and thought processes as we took notes.</p>
