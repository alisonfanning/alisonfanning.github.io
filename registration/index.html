			<h1>School Registration Design Projects</h1>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>As a leading provider of online registration and application solutions for K-12 schools, we built customized online forms for schools to collect data from their families. We then helped administrators process and report on the submitted data before ultimately transferring it back to the school's database.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>In my role as a project lead for public school districts, it was my responsibility to design and build a customized registration solution that would meet the district's goals and provide the best experience possible for each user of the solution.</p>
			<p>Solution users I designed for included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The families who completed the forms to provide data to the schools.</li>
				<li>The school administrators who processed the submitted data and prepared it to go to the database.</li>
				<li>The school's database which consumed the submitted data after it had been processed.</li>
				<li>The project stakeholders who reported on the registration process across the organization.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>The Approach</h2>
			<img class="image" src="images/registrationapproach.png" alt="Registration Approach Diagram">
			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<p>At the start of each project I led a kickoff call with the project stakeholders at the school. The goal was to understand the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Some basic information about the district.</li>
				<li>Their goals for moving to an online process.</li>
				<li>What they were hoping to accomplish in the first year.</li>
				<li>Their current business process for registering both new and returning students.</li>
				<li>What changes they wanted to make to their process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After the call, I would analyze the 10-50 pages of paper forms the district had previously sent to families at the start of the school year. I was looking to understand which students needed to complete each form, the type of data collected and any components that wouldn't work in an online format. For example, forms that required a doctor's signature would need to be available as a pdf for the family to print and complete at a later time so as not to hold up the rest of the registration process.</p>
			<p>I also reviewed screenshots of the school's database to be sure I understood the data storage structure and any customizations they had made. It was imperative that the solution I designed matched the structure of the database so the collected data would be easily deliverable at the end of the process.</p>
			<h3>Prototyping</h3>
			<p>Next I developed an initial version of the solution.</p>
			<p>I built a preview version of the online form that, unlike the paper forms, would collect each data point exactly once and do so in a structured, user-friendly way. I created an intuitive and efficient family process by focusing on the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="title">Hierarchy of Information</span> - I used explicit page and section titles that accurately described the questions within them. I emphasized this visually using headers and sub-headers to guide parents through the page.</li>
				<li><span class="title">Page Layout</span> - I placed required questions towards the top of the page so parents skimming through the form were more likely to see them the first time.</li>
				<li><span class="title">Use of Logic</span> - I added leading questions and logic which allowed me to show sections of the form only to the applicable subset of students.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the administrative side, I customized the toolset and built a business process for admins that balanced efficiency and practicality. Some schools only cared about getting the data back into the database as quickly as possible, others wanted to make sure they followed up with families or produced reports based on the answers to certain questions. I designed a custom workflow based on the district's existing process and stated goals for the online solution.</p>
			<h3>Testing</h3>
			<p>With the initial version of the solution complete, I led a call with the customer to provide a demo. I walked through the functionality and requested that the project team review it with their users to gather feedback. This initiated a period of revisions during which the school would request changes and I would consult on any implications to their various user groups.</p>
			<p>Once the solution was determined to be complete it was time to test functionality and usability. In addition to an extensive internal QA process, this generally included the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Testing of the solution by the project stakeholders.</li>
				<li>Testing of the form by a limited group of parents (who were often school administrators or teachers).</li>
				<li>Testing of the toolset by the school administrators.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Feedback collected during this time was incorporated as much as made sense at this point in the project lifecycle.</p>
			<h3>Deployment</h3>
			<p>With testing complete, the solution was launched and the school notified their community that registration was available online.</p>
			<h3>User Feedback</h3>
			<p>We received pretty immediate feedback if there was a major functionality issue with the solution; families would call our support line or the project team would reach out directly. Other feedback was filtered through the schools and we would hear about it during a post launch call with the customer.</p>
			<p>Any items that were critical or easy to fix were addressed right away. More challenging items had to wait to be incorporated until the following year when it would not affect a live solution.</p>
			<p>In addition to gathering feedback directly after launch, we conducted end-of-season calls with each customer. This provided us an opportunity to step back and examine if the solution fully met the needs of each of the users: families, admins, project stakeholders and the database. If not, we brainstormed about what could be improved the following year.</p>
			<h3>Iteration</h3>
			<p>After the first year the project process shifted slightly since we were iterating on a previously developed solution. After an initial project kickoff call we would provide the preview version of the previous year's solution and initiate a period of revisions.</p>
			<p class="final">This cycle allowed us to adjust and continually improve on the solution, incorporating user feedback from the previous year. Typically, after a couple of years we would get to a relatively stable solution that could then be used year-after-year.</p>
