		<p>Hello! My name is Alison Fanning and I live in Somerville, MA. I've spent the past several years working at an ed-tech company in a variety of roles: implementation specialist, project manager, consultant, and team leader (sometimes all at the same time!). I'm excited to be a student at Startup Institute to help me transition to a career in web design. Outside of work I enjoy baking, playing board games, and exploring markets of any kind.</p>
